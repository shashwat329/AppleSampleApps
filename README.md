1. **[About Me](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/aboutme)** - Welcome to the About Me app. In this walkthrough, youâ€™ll learn the basics of using SwiftUI to display information across multiple tab views.
Run the preview and tap to select the Home, Story, Favorites, and Fun Facts tabs at the bottom of the screen.
You can change all of the data, or content, in the app to be about any topic of your choice. While you walk through this sample, try swapping out the information and edit colors and modifiers to suit your style.
